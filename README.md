# freeCodeCamp-Scientific-Programming-with-Python
Compilation of all of my final projects for the Scientific Programming with Python course on freeCodeCamp.

- My certification can be found at the following link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/edzhangg/scientific-computing-with-python-v7
- NOTE: In each folder, main.py, README.md, .replit, and test_module.py were given already and are not my work. Only the other python file in each folder is my work
- These projects are done on Replit; my username is edzhangg.
